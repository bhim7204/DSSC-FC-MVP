# DSSC-FC-MVP

This project is based on the research and implementation of the ML algorithms on financial data which is conducted under the name of fictional company called Data Science Solution Company (DSSC). The main objective of this report is to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for the client company called Financial Company (FC) which offers financial consultation to the clients who want to invest in stocks. Therefore, we have carried out this project to use the AI/ML model in the stock market data for predicting the stock price and provide the recommendation to the users. We are carrying this project with the assumption that the stock market trend will follow certain pattern which will recur after certain time period. So based on this assumption and the historical data of the stock price, we can predict the future price of that stock and hence recommend the users of our system based on the result. We will be using yahoofinance API to get the data and pandas to preprocess the data.
