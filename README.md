# DSSC-FC-MVP
You are currently working as a WIL project student at our college and therefore you are an employee of our WIL Office. WIL Office acts as a parent company for many fictional companies that will be used in one or more cases during your WIL project semester. Each week, you will be given a case study that belongs to a fictional company. Some weeks may use the same fictional company and some weeks may introduce new ones. In todayâ€™s market, many organizations offer services to multiple clients. To make your WIL project experience as close as possible to real activities in an organization, we have planned this hybrid structure to let you develop the hard and soft skills needed to work with multiple companies at the same time.  
 
 
You will be provided with additional information about the organization each week and be asked to document your responses to several key deliverables.  Each case study presented is associated with a relevant topic and realistic situation relevant to your field of study. Case studies will provide practice in analyzing and making decisions in a work environment.
